I'm a tech guy, lost in a tech world. I am a jack of all trades, knowing a lot about a lot, but not an expert most fields. If I have to do something I want to know what I am doing and have a sound understanding of it. Because of this I tend to not use many frameworks right off, and I stay away from ones that become popular too fast.

I finished High School in 2001, and received my Bachelor of Science in 2007 from the Computer Science Department at Texas Christian University. I married my wife, Stacey, in March of 2008. We bought our first home in November of 2008.

I've been a Sacker and Cashier at Winn-Dixie, Swimming Pool Expert, Micro-Computer specialist, Senior Web Administrator, Systems Administrator, and a Senior Developer. I was born and raised in Texas, only lived outside of Texas while at MCRD, San Diego.

I've traveled outside the country on a few occasions. A couple of cruises, a trip to Austria, family vacation in the Bahamas and our honeymoon in St. Thomas. I wish I had the time and money to see more places.

I enjoy a small group of close friends, good dinner with the extended family, and the evenings I get to spend with my Wife.

I am a workaholic. If I have a job to do, it doesn't matter for who, I want it done right. I want to branch off on my own one day, but I don't necessarily want to be the CEO of my own company. I just want to build things!

Writing one of these is a lot like a resume, just a bit more personal ...
