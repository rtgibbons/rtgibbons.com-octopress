Like I said earlier, I am a jack of all trades, and that isn't a stretch.

I've worked at Winn Dixie, Leslie's Swimming Pool Supplies, Ron Walk Associates, True Solutions, and Rassai Interactive, now know as Algorhythm. From my first two jobs, I learned quite a bit even though they were my jobs through High School and College. Learned about retail shops, customer satisfaction and most importantly how to deal with upset customers. In between Leslie's and my next job I did a bit of time in the military. I joined the Marine Corps and during boot camp developed fractures in my shins, and was Honorable discharged for medical reasons. Obviously spending 6 months in Marine Corps bootcamp teaches you a lot of different things. Out of boot camp I got a job with RWA, which is a IT Consultant. I was primarily on the contract with the US Army Corps of Engineers. This is where I really honed my IT skill and put them to the test. I was soon trusted with full network and server access. From there I was hired on at True Solutions, and as the Senior Web Developer. I managed their site and their servers while I was there. Keeping their e-commerce, learning management system, and website up to date and running. I am currently at Algorhythm, which was recently re-branded from Rassai Interactive. I was hired on here as their System Administator and I am now maintain their internal and external infrastructure, I am also the technical lead with development.

After boot camp, I went back to school and finished up my degree at Texas Christian University, with a BS in Computer Information Technology. This is a program in the Computer Science Department, and is basically a Computer Science Degree with some Junior and Senior level classes replaced with Business Management. I really love programming, it is the root of my interest in IT. Even as a System Administrator, I am giving back to the open source community with Bug Fixes and written small scripts.
