I've haven't used a manufacturer's  firmware on my router in YEARS. Seriously since like 2003 or 2004. I started of using <a title="OpenWRT" href="http://openwrt.org" target="_blank">OpenWRT</a>, which was the first one out there of this kind. It allowed you to run Linux on your Linksys router. This was freaking awesome. I used, loved it, and might of fried one or two routers in the process :/

Since then there have been several different spin offs and IMHO, better ones out there. For the last several years I've been running DD-WRT on my Linksys WRT54G (The same one that I originally put OpenWRT on, fried, and then fixed). I found myself need to extend my wireless network, but not in the normal since of wireless. I need to turn a switch into a wireless client so I could have a hard wired connection on the other end.

I started searching for a new router, one that would last me a while, and more importantly. One I could hack. The short of a very long process for me, I settled on a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SISM5W?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=unknown0bb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002SISM5W" target="_blank">ASUS RT-N16</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=unknown0bb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002SISM5W" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />. This thing is loaded, 32MB of storage, 128MB of ram, and480 Mhz processor. It supports B, G and N. Pretty nifty. I got it, fired it up. And spent just enough time in the Asus firmware to load up <a title="DD WRT" href="http://www.dd-wrt.com" target="_blank">DD-WRT</a>.

I took my old Linksys and converted it into a wireless client. So no, it is just one huge switch. What I have is the wireless portion of it is just like the wireless in a laptop, and it connects to my router. Then all the ports on the back are just like a normal switch. I can now plug my desktop computers in my office up to it, and they are all on my network. It's a pretty slick setup.

The connection between the Linksys router (now switch) and the Asus router is a bit flaky at times. And this is because of a multitude of reasons. The biggest being the number of walls the signal has to travel through. But I am working on fixing that one (moving the Asus router out of the bedroom one day). The other problem is the DD-WRT firmware on the Asus router. The router requires a beta release of DD-WRT running the 2.6 kernel. Older versions used the 2.4 kernel. But to support a wider ranger or routers (including this Asus) they had to use the 2.6 Kernel. There are still some bugs, and some things are quite working like they are suppose to, but that is why it is a beta release.

Overall, I am very happy with everything. As long as I can resist the temptation of tinkering with them. The connection remains really stable.
