## Welcome Back

I've finally got around to finsihing the migration of Wordpress to Octopress. I could post how I didn't, but all I really did was follow this [wiki page from the Jekyll repo](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Blog-Migrations). I guess if you need help, feel free to leave a comment and I'll help out where I can.

I didn't switch of anything bad with Wordpress, just wanting something different and didn't want to work with an entire RDBMS and language stack again. So this looked cool and fun.

I did take this oppurtunity to clean out old post and just carry over a handful of posts that still seem useful. I've disabled comments on these because I they are still really old and I don't have access to those enviroments to provide support. Again, if you need help with one, just hit me on on twitter and I'll do what I can.
